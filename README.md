### **Model Tuning - Proactive Maintenance for Generators on Wind Turbines**
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in wind energy production using machine learning and has collected data on generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one to help identify failures so that the generator can be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

### **Business Statistics - A/B Testing for Website Modification**
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.
