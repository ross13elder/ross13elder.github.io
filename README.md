#### **Model Tuning - Proactive Maintenance for Generators on Wind Turbines**
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in wind energy production using machine learning and has collected data on generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one to help identify failures so that the generator can be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
- *Skills*: Up and Downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter Tuning, Pipelines, Ensemble Techniques, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost

#### **Supervised Learning - Building Predictive Model and Identify Key Factors**
Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which bookings will be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
- *Skills*: Data Preprocessing, Logistic Regression, Multicollinearity, AUC-ROC Curve, Decision Tree, Pruning
- Sep 2023

#### **Linear Regression - Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Retail**
Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model that will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.
- *Skills*: Linear Regression, Multicollinearity, Linear Regression Assumptions, Business Insights and Recommendations, EDA
- August 2023

#### **Business Statistics - A/B Testing for Website Modification**
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.
- *Skills*: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference

#### **FoodHub Order Analysis Using Python**
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
